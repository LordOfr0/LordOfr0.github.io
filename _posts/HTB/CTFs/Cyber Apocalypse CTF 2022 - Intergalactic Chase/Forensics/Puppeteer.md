## CHALLENGE INFO
> Planet Longhir is known for it's top-tier researchers.
> Due to their dedication in science and engineering, their military equipment is the most advanced one in the galaxy.
> In fact, the prototype DES-3000, a self-propelled precision-strike missile that is capable of reaching targets even in Ratnik galaxy, is being used to disable Galactic Federation's communication satellites.
> The mystery that Miyuki is trying to solve is, how the satellite's location was leaked since it is a top-sercret that only Galactic Federation's council is aware of.
> Help her analyse the Council's HQ event logs and solve this mystery.

We are provided with a zip file `forensics_puppeteer.zip` containing a directory called `Logs` containing windows event log files. As can be seen in the picture below.
![alt text](Puppeteer.png)
Going for the low hanging fruit, I search for the powershell event logs, showing me the following files to search through.
![alt text](Puppeteer2.png)
Opening the `Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell%4Operational.evtx` and clickign through the few alerts being logged i note a suspicious looking script being run called `Path: C:\sysmgr\special_orders.ps1`![alt text](Puppeteer3.png)
The contents of this script can be seen below.

It looks like the script is doing some manipulations to the byte arrays mentioned above.
Knowing a little powershell you can make the powershell script do all the work for you, and give the output of the unpacking routine for you. I just remove the event log added comments, and remove the CreateThread function since I do not want it to execute any code on my VM and then replace that with a  `$stage3|Write-Host`  to print the final unpacked code.

Then knowing common number base representations this looks like base 10, which we can quickly be decoded in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) like so giving us the flag.
