## CHALLENGE INFO
> A CEO of a startup company reported that he could no longer access his Password Vault.
> It seems the password has been changed, but he states not to have done so.
> He reports receiving a birthday invitation to a Paintball party the week before.
> A few days later, his Italian friend told him that her email had been hacked, and she never sent out those birthday invites.
> He fears his lost password might have something to do with that birthday invite.
> Their SOC team confirmed their fears by admitting that this document escaped their attention and didn’t trigger an alert.
> Now they want us, ENIGMA, to analyze the provided network capture they took that day as well as the document sent via his friends’ email.
