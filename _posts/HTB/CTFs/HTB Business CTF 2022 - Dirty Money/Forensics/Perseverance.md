## CHALLENGE INFO
> During a recent security assessment of a well-known consulting company, the competent team found some employees' credentials in publicly available breach databases.
> Thus, they called us to trace down the actions performed by these users.
> During the investigation, it turned out that one of them had been compromised.
> Although their security engineers took the necessary steps to remediate and secure the user and the internal infrastructure, the user was getting compromised repeatedly.
> Narrowing down our investigation to find possible persistence mechanisms, we are confident that the malicious actors use WMI to establish persistence.
> You are given the WMI repository of the user's workstation.
> Can you analyze and expose their technique?
